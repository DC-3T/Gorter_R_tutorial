# The A to Z of R - Basic commands to beautiful plots with ggplot
A repository containing materials for a Gorter meeting tutorial on R.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DC-3T/Gorter_R_tutorial/HEAD)

The aim of this presentation is to introduce participants to the basics of the R programming language.

The session will cover: the absolute basics of R - assigning variables, creating dataframes, simple functions; the 'grammar of graphics' - creating beautiful plots with ggplot2; and how to run correlations and produce correlograms. 

The tutorial will *not* cover the basics of statistical analysis, or which tests to perform when. We assume a basic knowledge of statistics.

See below some additional resources for learning R and ggplot2.
